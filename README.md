TextCompress (aka MNRC-LC (Minimal Non-Redundant Coding for Lossless Compression))
============

TextCompress is an old in-house developer compression alghoritm suited for plain text compression (better if in UNICODE).
This repository contains a shitty implementation made 4-5 years ago.

While the implementation is the worse of the world, I think the principles and thery behind this work are pretty interesintg, so I'd suggest to have a read to it.
